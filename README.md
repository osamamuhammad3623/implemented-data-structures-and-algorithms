# implemented-data-structures-and-algorithms
Basic implementation of some Data Structures and Algorithms.

*Binary tree implementation:
Basic methods are implemented, such as inserting new ndoes, finding the max and the min nodes, searching for a node if it exists and showing all nodes in order.

*Linked list implementaion:
