# implemented-data-structures-and-algorithms
Basic implementation of some Data Structures and Algorithms.

# Binary tree implementation:
Basic methods are implemented, such as inserting new ndoes, finding the max and the min nodes, searching for a node if it exists, showing all nodes in order checking if a node has left or right children and showing the path from the root to a specific node !

# Linked list implementaion:
Basic methods are implemented, such as inserting new nodes in the beginning of the list, inserting in the back of the list, deleting nodes
, searching for a node if it exists, checking if the list is empty or not, and showing all elements.

# Stack implementation:
Basic methods are implemented, such as inserting new nodes, popping/deleting nodes, searching for a node if it exists, checking if the list is empty or not, and showing all elements.

# Merge sort algorithm

# Selection sort algorithm

# Binary search algorithm

# String Match (Brute Force) algorithm
